# Simple App with Next.js

This project is built using Next.js. It's a relatively simple project that relies on APIs and explores various features of Next.js, such as:

- Multiple routing scenarios
- Handling synchronous and asynchronous functions
- Creating a loading component
- Experimenting with the suspense component

Additionally, we delve into various rendering scenarios like:

- SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- SSG (Static Site Generation)
- ISG (Incremental Static Generation)
- CSR (Client-Side Rendering)
